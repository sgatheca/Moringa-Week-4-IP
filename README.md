#Electric Car Sharing Project by Autolib

**Business Overview**
Autolib was an electric car sharing service which was inaugurated in Paris, France, in 2011. It closed on 31 July 2018. It was operated by the Bolloré industrial group. The Autolib service maintained a fleet of all-electric Bolloré Bluecars for public use on a paid subscription basis, employing a citywide network of parking and charging stations. As of 3 July 2016, 3,980 Bluecars had been registered for the service and had more than 126,900 registered subscribers;  Autolib furthermore offered 1,084 electric car stations in Paris agglomeration with 5,935 charging points.

**Business Objectives**
Our objective was to identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.
Other objectives were:
* Identify the most popular hour for returning cars
* Identify the most popular station
* Identify the most popular picking hour
* Identify the most popular postal code for picking up Blue cars
* Compare the most popular picking hour considering Utilib and Utilib4 as compared to Bluecars.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
From sour analysis, we recommend that the users can pick the cars at the most popular time which is 6AM and recommend to the service providers to add more vehicles at that time.
Since the most popular station was Fontenay-aux-Roses/Robert Marchard/32, we recommend having more slots in that station. The most popular time for returning cars is 17HRS, we, therefore, recommend having advertising agencies run adverts at that hour in the parking slots.
Comparing the most popular picking hour considering Utilib and Utilib4 as compared to Bluecars, each car type had different popular picking hours. The most popular picking hour for Bluecar was 19HRS, Utilib was 12HRS and Utilib 1.4 was 23HRS. We therefore recommend to users to select the type of car depending on availability.
